# Sales-Report-Analysis
## Overview

This repository contains the code and assets for a comprehensive Sales Dashboard project that I completed. The project was executed as part of my work with [Meriskill](https://www.meriskill.com/), and it leverages Power BI for data visualization and analysis.

## Key Features

- **Top-Selling Product**: Identified the best-selling product, the MacBook Pro laptop.
- **Total Sales Metrics**: Visualized critical revenue metrics, including total sales, orders, and order quantity.
- **Product Sales Distribution**: Utilized a pie chart to showcase sales distribution by product.
- **Geographical Insights**: Analyzed orders by city, offering valuable geographic insights.
- **Top-Repeating Products**: Discovered the top repeating products through a bar chart.
- **City-wise Sales Trends**: Explored sales trends in different cities via a waterfall chart.
- **Sales Trends Over Time**: Visualized sales trends over time, highlighting the high-sales quarter of 2019.
- **Top 10 Cities**: Identified the top 10 selling cities using a funnel chart, with San Francisco leading.

## Insights and Observations

The project led to several key insights, including the dominance of the MacBook Pro laptop as the top-selling product, the importance of San Francisco as a high-revenue city, and the significance of the fourth quarter of 2019 as the peak sales period. These insights have informed data-driven decisions and strategy adjustments to optimize sales performance.
